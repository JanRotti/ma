\section{Artificial Viscosity}	
Necessary additional term introduced to achieve numerical stability that comes from the discretization of the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equation. It is only active in the streamline direction of the calculation and is dependent on $\Delta t$ therefore yielding only higher order effects.
