This new technique retains and improves the convergence properties to the stationary solution. When compared with the conventional dual time-stepping, the method with two derivatives reduces the stiness of the problem and requires fewer iterations for full convergence to steady-state. In the current formulation, these positive eects require that an approximation of the square root of the spatial operator is available and inexpensive.},

For incompressible flows, only the kinematic variables are important, and the techniques are well known. In a compressible flow, both the kinematic and thermodynamic variables are dynamically important, and must be included in the configuration space. We introduce an energy-based inner product which may be used to obtain POD modes for this configuration space. We then obtain an approximate version of the Navier–Stokes equations, valid for cold flows at moderate Mach number, and project these equations onto a POD basis. The resulting equations of motion are quadratic, and are much simpler than projections of the full compressible Navier–Stokes equations.},

It provides motivation and unifying ideas in using finite elements as a numerical strategy arising from the need of rendering a continuous problem to its discrete version. The chapter introduces the intermediate procedure of the concept of polynomial interpolation and gives a swift overture of the numerical integration. It compares the behavior of two approximation procedures for an ordinary differential equation and a partial differential equation using monomials and piecewise linears. The chapter deals with the issue of Galerkin approximation, its efficiency, reliability, and other qualitative properties. It gives a detailed study of the interpolation concept in one dimension. The chapter also introduces the L2-projection, which is a kind of analytic approximation procedure that often serves as an intermediate step in the finite element approximation.}

	abstract={In many fields of science and engineering, like fluid or structural mechanics and electric circuit design, large--scale dynamical systems need to be simulated, optimized or controlled. They are often given by discretizations of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations yielding high--dimensional discrete phase spaces. for this reason during the last decades research was mainly focused on the development of sophisticated analytical and numerical tools to understand the overall system behavior. Not surprisingly, the number of degrees of freedom for simulations keptpace with the increasing computing power. But when it comes to optimal design or control the problems are in general to large to be tackled with standard techniques. Hence, there is a strong need for model reduction techniques to reduce the computational costs and storage requirements. They should yield low--dimensional approximations for the full high--dimensional dynamical system, which reproduce the characteristic dynamics of the system.},

	abstract = {In the context of the numerical solution of parametrized partial differential equations, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provides a basis of a subspace of the solution space. The method relies on a singular value decomposition of a snapshot matrix, which contains the numerical solutions at predefined parameter values. Often a sufficiently accurate representation of the solution can be given by a linear combination of a small number of POD basis functions. In this case, using POD basis functions as test and trial functions in a Galerkin projection leads to POD-Galerkin reduced-order models. Such models are derived and tested in this thesis for flow problems governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic Dirichlet boundary conditions.
	
	In the first part of the thesis, POD-Galerkin reduced-order models are developed for unsteady deterministic problems of increasing complexity: heat conduction, isothermal flow, and thermoconvective flow. Here, time acts as a parameter, so that the snapshot matrix consists of discrete solutions at different times. Special attention is paid to the reduced-order computation of the pressure field, which is realized by projecting a discrete pressure Poisson equation onto a pressure POD basis. It is demonstrated that the reduced-order solutions of the considered problems converge toward the underlying snapshots when the dimension of the POD basis is increased.
	
	The second part of the thesis is devoted to a steady thermally driven flow problem with a temperature Dirichlet boundary condition given by a spatially correlated random field. In order to compute statistical quantities of interest, the stochastic problem is split into separate deterministic sub-problems by means of a Karhunen-Loeve parametrization of the boundary data and subsequent stochastic collocation on a sparse grid. The sub-problems are solved with suitable POD-Galerkin models. Different methods to handle the parametrized Dirichlet conditions are introduced and compared. The use of POD-Galerkin reduced-order models leads to a significant speed-up of the overall computational process compared to a standard finite element model.}

SU2 is a computational analysis and design package that has been developed to solve multiphysics analysis and optimization tasks using unstructured mesh topologies. Its unique architecture is well suited for extensibility to treat partial-differential-equation-based problems not initially envisioned. The common framework adopted enables the rapid implementation of new physics packages that can be tightly coupled to form a powerful ensemble of analysis tools to address complex problems facing many engineering communities. The framework is demonstrated on a number, solving both the flow and adjoint systems of equations to provide a high-fidelity predictive capability and sensitivity information that can be used for optimal shape design using a gradient-based framework, goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement, or uncertainty quantification.}
